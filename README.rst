ClassRegistry
=============
At the intersection of the Registry and Factory patterns lies the ``ClassRegistry``:

- Define global factories that generate new class instances based on configurable keys.
- Seamlessly create powerful service registries.
- Integrate with setuptools's ``entry_points`` system to make your registries infinitely
  extensible by 3rd-party libraries!
- And more!


Getting Started
---------------
Create a registry using the ``class_registry.ClassRegistry`` class, then
decorate any classes that you wish to register with its ``register`` method:

.. code-block:: python

   from class_registry import ClassRegistry

   pokedex = ClassRegistry()

   @pokedex.register('fire')
   class Charizard(Pokemon):
     ...

   @pokedex.register('grass')
   class Bulbasaur(Pokemon):
     ...

   @pokedex.register('water')
   class Squirtle(Pokemon):
     ...

To create a class instance from a registry, use the subscript operator:

.. code-block:: python

   # Charizard, I choose you!
   fighter1 = pokedex['fire']

   # CHARIZARD fainted!
   # How come my rival always picks the type that my pokÃ©mon is weak against??
   fighter2 = pokedex['grass']

.. tip::

   If a ``ClassRegistry`` always returns objects derived from a particular base
   class, you can annotate it to help with type checking, autocomplete, etc.:

   .. code-block:: python

      # Annotate the registry with ``[Pokemon]``:
      pokedex = ClassRegistry[Pokemon]()

      # Your IDE will automatically infer that ``fighter1`` is a ``Pokemon``.
      fighter1 = pokedex['fire']


Advanced Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There's a whole lot more you can do with ClassRegistry, including:

- Provide args and kwargs to new class instances.
- Automatically register non-abstract classes.
- Integrate with setuptools's ``entry_points`` system so that 3rd-party libraries can
  add their own classes to your registries.
- Wrap your registry in an instance cache to create a service registry.
- And more!

`ReadTheDocs <https://class-registry.readthedocs.io/>`_!


Requirements
------------
ClassRegistry is known to be compatible with the following Python versions:

- 3.12
- 3.11
- 3.10

.. note::

   I'm only one person, so to keep from getting overwhelmed, I'm only committing to
   supporting the 3 most recent versions of Python.  ClassRegistry's code is pretty
   simple, so it's likely to be compatible with versions not listed here; there just
   won't be any test coverage to prove it ðŸ˜‡

Installation
------------
Install the latest stable version via pip::

   pip install phx-class-registry

.. important::

   Make sure to install `phx-class-registry`, **not** `class-registry`.  I created the
   latter at a previous job years ago, and after I left they never touched that project
   again and stopped responding to my emails â€” so in the end I had to fork it ðŸ¤·

Maintainers
===========
To install the distribution for local development, some additional setup is required:

#. `Install poetry <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>`_ (only needs to be
   done once).

#. Run the following command to install additional dependencies::

      poetry install --with=dev

#. Activate pre-commit hook::

      poetry run autohooks activate --mode=poetry

Running Unit Tests
------------------
Run the tests for all supported versions of Python using
`tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/>`_::

   poetry run tox -p

Or to run tests in the current virtualenv::

   poetry run pytest

Documentation
-------------
To build the documentation locally:

#. Switch to the ``docs`` directory::

    cd docs

#. Build the documentation::

    make html

Releases
--------
Steps to build releases are based on
`Packaging Python Projects Tutorial <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/>`_.

.. important::

   Make sure to build releases off of the ``main`` branch, and check that all changes
   from ``develop`` have been merged before creating the release!

1. Build the Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Delete artefacts from previous builds, if applicable::

    rm dist/*

#. Run the build::

    poetry build

#. The build artefacts will be located in the ``dist`` directory at the top
   level of the project.

2. Upload to PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. `Create a PyPI API token <https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/>`_ (you only have to
   do this once).
#. Increment the version number in ``pyproject.toml``.
#. Upload build artefacts to PyPI::

    poetry publish

3. Create GitHub Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Create a tag and push to GitHub::

      git tag <version>
      git push <version>

   ``<version>`` must match the updated version number in ``pyproject.toml``.

#. Go to the `Releases page for the repo`_.
#. Click ``Draft a new release``.
#. Select the tag that you created in step 1.
#. Specify the title of the release (e.g., ``ClassRegistry v1.2.3``).
#. Write a description for the release.  Make sure to include:
   - Credit for code contributed by community members.
   - Significant functionality that was added/changed/removed.
   - Any backwards-incompatible changes and/or migration instructions.
   - SHA256 hashes of the build artefacts.
#. GPG-sign the description for the release (ASCII-armoured).
#. Attach the build artefacts to the release.
#. Click ``Publish release``.
